# OOPProject
Football League program as a part of my university's Object Oriented Programming course
The program randomly generates all the events of a league.
It outputs an overview and stats for players, teams and the whole league.
The output designed to be modular, so it can be tailored to suit your favourite interface.

Update:
* Added a GUI to the program
* Changed the name of some classes and methods to be development-friendly
